It's like a safety net that catches you financially if something unexpected happens, like an accident or a big illness. Insurance companies collect a bit of money from everyone (called a premium) to create a pool of funds. Then, if someone needs help, they can tap into that pool to cover their costs. It's a way to share the risk and make sure everyone has some peace of mind, even when things don't go according to plan.Why do I need Insurance? Think of insurance as an umbrella on a rainy day. Insurance products help you in not only mitigating risks but also helps you by providing a financial cushion against adverse financial burdens suffered. It gives you peace of mind knowing you won't be stuck with a huge financial burden if something goes wrong.What is General Insurance?

Think of the premium as your regular payment to the insurance company for having your policy. It's kind of like a subscription fee that keeps your coverage active.What is deductible ? There's usually an amount you pay upfront for any claim, kind of like a co-pay at the doctor's. This amount is called a deductible, and it gets subtracted from the total cost of the claim before the insurance company figures out how much they'll cover.", 'What is underwriting? Imagine you\'re thinking about insuring something, like your car. Underwriting is like that first step where the insurance company weighs the ins and outs. They\'ll consider all the important details to see if they\'re comfortable taking on the risk of insuring you, and if so, how much it would costWhat is the period of General Insurance policies? Most General Insurance plans are annual in nature. You pay for a year of coverage, and then you renew it if you want to keep the protection going.Do I have to renew policy every year? Yes, most insurance policies need to be renewed annually to continue the coverage.How much Insurance do I need ? Having the right amount of coverage on your insurance policies is key! Whether it\'s for your car, house, or other valuables, think about what it would cost to replace everything new (that\'s the market value) or rebuild it from scratch (reinstatement value). This will help you decide how much "sum insured" you need. If that number isn\'t high enough, you\'ll end up having to pay for some of the cost yourself if something happens.Why should I fill up proposal form for buying Insurance? Think of insurance like an agreement between you and the company. To get started, you fill out a proposal form, kind of like offering them the details they need. This form has all the important information they use to create your actual policy, which is the official contract.Why do I require Motor Insurance? Imagine you\'re cruising down the road and oops! An accident happens. Motor insurance is there to give you peace of mind in two ways:\n1. It protects your own car: Whether it\'s a fender bender or something more serious, insurance helps cover the repair costs to get your vehicle back on the road.\n2. It handles Third-Party Liability: This legal term basically means if you accidentally injure someone or damage their property while driving, your insurance will step in to cover the costs, as determined by law.\n\nBy the way, having Third-Party Liability insurance isn\'t optional - it\'s a must by law, according to the Motor Vehicle Act. That\'s because you\'re responsible for any harm your car causes to others on the road. Think of it as being a good neighbor behind the wheel! And speaking of the law, driving without insurance can lead to fines, so it\'s definitely best to be covered.What are Add on covers to Motor Insurance? Imagine your car insurance policy as a great safety net. Add-on covers are like little patches you can add to strengthen that net in specific areas. For a bit extra each month, you can get coverage for things that might not be included in your base policy.\n\nHere are some popular add-on covers to consider:\n- Zero depreciation cover: This helps you avoid paying out of pocket for depreciation (the decrease in value) on replaced parts after an accident.\n- Loss of personal belongings cover: Protects your belongings that get stolen or damaged inside the car during a break-in.\n- Pay-as-you-drive cover: This is a good option for occasional drivers, as your premium is based on how much you actually drive.\n- Daily conveyance cover: This provides you with a taxi or rental car allowance if your car is in the garage for repairs after an accident.\n- Roadside assistance: This is a lifesaver if your car breaks down on the road. You can get help with things like flat tires, towing, or even a jump start.\n\nThese are just a few examples, and there are many other add-on covers available depending on your insurance company. It\'s a good idea to chat with your insurer about what might be a good fit for your needs and driving habits.', 'Whats is IDV? Have you ever wondered about the value your car insurance policy places on your car? That\'s where IDV, or Insured Declared Value, comes in. It\'s basically a fancy way of saying how much your insurer will cover if your car gets stolen or totaled.\n\nHere\'s how it works: They take the manufacturer\'s current selling price for your car model and then factor in how much its worth has decreased over time due to age (that\'s depreciation). This gives them the IDV, which is the maximum amount they\'ll pay out in a worst-case scenario.When should I approach Insurance company for renewal of my motor policy? You should approach Insurance company at least 15 days before expiry of your existing policy period.What is "No Claim Bonus"? Have you heard of NCB? It stands for No Claim Bonus, which is basically a reward insurance companies give you for not incurring claims! The idea is, if you don\'t make any claims during your policy period, you get a discount on your premium the next time you renew. It starts at 20% off the cost of Own Damage protection (not including damage to other vehicles), and can go all the way up to 50% off depending on how many years you go claim-free. \n\nHere\'s the breakdown:\n- Year 1 with no claims: 20% discount\n- Year 2 with no claims: 25% discount\n- Year 3 with no claims: 35% discount\n- Year 4 with no claims: 45% discount\n- Year 5 and onwards with no claims: Maxes out at 50% discount\n\nBut keep in mind, if you do need to file a claim, you lose your NCB discount for the next year. So, safe driving pays off!What happens to NCB on transfer of a vehicle? Think of NCB as a loyalty reward for you, the driver, not the car itself. So, if you sell your car, you can transfer the insurance policy to the new owner, but they won\'t get your NCB discount. They\'ll basically pay a bit extra for the remaining insurance period because they don\'t have their own NCB yet. \n\nThe good news is, you can use your NCB on a new car you buy to save on your own insurance premium!Will my No Claim Bonus (NCB) get ported if I want to change my insurance company? The good news is, you can definitely keep your No Claim Bonus (NCB) even if you switch insurance companies when it\'s time to renew your policy. To make sure everything goes smoothly, just have your renewal notice from your current insurer handy. That document will show your No Claim Bonus.\n\nIf you can\'t find that notice, no worries! You can also use your original expiring policy document, along with a statement from your current insurer confirming you haven\'t made any claims during the past year.Can I transfer my NCB? Normally, No Claim Bonus (NCB) can\'t be switched to a different person\'s policy. But there is an exception: if the policyholder sadly passes away, their spouse can take advantage of the NCB on a new policy.\n\nAnother exception applies if the car insurance is currently under a company name, and you, as the driver, want to switch it to your own name. In this case, you can still get the NCB discount as long as you have a NOC (No Objection Certificate) from the company.', 'What is the procedure to retain my NCB if I am selling my vehicle? If you\'re selling your car, here\'s what you\'ll need to do to transfer your No Claim Bonus (NCB) to a new policy:\n1. Cancel your current car insurance: You\'ll need to officially cancel your existing policy.\n2. Gather your documents:\na. Originals: Get your original car insurance policy document and proof of insurance handy.\nb. Forms: You\'ll also need to fill out Form 29 and Form 30 (these are forms related to transferring ownership of the car and your NCB).\nc. Letter: Write a quick letter explaining why you\'re canceling your policy (mention selling the car).\n3. Request the NCB transfer certificate: Once you\'ve submitted everything to your insurer, they\'ll issue you an NCB transfer certificate.\n4.

And the best part? You can use it with any insurer, even a different one from the one who gave you the certificate.What is a Certificate of Insurance under Motor Vehicle Act? You\'ll want to let the RTA (Regional Transport Authority) know about the change in your vehicle registration certificate (RC).

What is Portfolio Management Services (PMS)? Only SEBI registered Portfolio Managers can offer Portfolio Management Services.Q2. Who can offer PMS in India? So, when it comes to Portfolio Management Services, there are three main types to know about:\n\n1. Discretionary PMS: Here, the Portfolio Manager takes the reins and makes the decisions for you\n2. Non-Discretionary PMS: The Portfolio Manager gives suggestions, but the final call is yours.\n3. Advisory PMS: You call the shots, and the Portfolio Manager puts your decisions into action\n\nFun fact: In India, most companies usually offer Discretionary Portfolio Management Services.Q3. What are the types of PMS? Individuals, HUF, Partnership Firms, LLP, Body Corporates, and NRIs (following RBI guidelines for a Portfolio Investment Scheme Account) can all open PMS accounts.Q4. Who can open a PMS Account? Absolutely! NRIs have options when it comes to investing in PMS using either NRE or NRO accounts. The NRE account is where NRIs can stash their foreign earnings, while the NRO account helps handle the income earned within India. It's like having a choice between different piggy banks for your money!", 'Q6. What is a PIS Account? So, here\'s the deal in simpler terms: when you or someone you\'re connected with does any transactions (like investing, holding shares, etc.) in a year, the charges for these services shouldn’t go over 20% of the total value for each service. And this applies to things like holding shares, keeping them safe, and other similar services. Also, if they charge you or your connected associates for something, it can’t be more expensive than what they charge people who aren\'t connected at all.\n\nLet\'s say you\'re using a broker for trading. The total amount you pay that broker, who\'s somehow connected to you, can\'t be more than 20% of all the fees you pay to brokers for trading throughout the year.\nAnd if you have different brokers you\'re connected with, each of them can only take up to 20% of the total fees you pay to brokers for handling your trades in a year.\n\nI hope that makes sense? It\'s all about keeping things fair when you and your connections deal with money matters.Q7. Can a minor open a PMS Account? These are a few risks you need to be wary of:\n- Macro Risk – Systematic Risk\n- Industry Risk - Systematic Risk\n- Company Risk – Un-Systematic Risk\n- Market Risk\n- Liquidity Risk\n- Re-Investment Risk\n- Credit Risk\n- Operational RiskQ8. How does the restriction on associates party apply to PMS? In the simplest terms, ‘High Watermark’ ensures you only pay performance fees when your investment surpasses previous peaks. ‘High Water Mark’ is the higher of either ‘corpus investment value’ or ‘highest\' NAV at which performance fees have been paid historically’.\n\nFor example, let\'s say a client’s initial contribution is ₹1 Cr which then rises to ₹1.25 Cr in the first year. In this case, a performance fee would be payable on the ₹25,00,000 return. \nNow, let\'s say, that the portfolio value drops to ₹1.1 Cr next year. In this case, no performance fee has to be paid. Now, in the third year, the portfolio value rises again to₹1.4 Cr. Here, the performance fee will be payable only on the ₹15,00,000 which is more than the previously achieved high watermark of ₹1.25 Cr.Q11. Are there risk associated in PMS? "No catch-up" means that the profit share only applies to the extra return beyond a certain target rate.\n\nLet\'s break it down: Say a portfolio grows from ₹100 to ₹120 in a year. If the fee structure had a hurdle rate set at 8% (which is ₹108), then the profit share is calculated only on the amount that\'s above this hurdle rate. So, in this case, the profit share would apply to just ₹12 (which is ₹120 - ₹108), not on the entire profit of₹20.', "Q12. What are the risks involved in investments? Here's a simpler way to look at it: the time-weighted rate of return splits up how much your investment grows or shrinks over specific periods, taking into account when you put money in or took money out of your Fund. It's like breaking down the performance of your investment into different time chunks!Q13. What is ‘High Watermarking’ ? Sure thing! Before you and the Portfolio Manager team up, they'll give you a heads-up by sharing a Disclosure Document.
